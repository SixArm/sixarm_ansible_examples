# Create a AWS EC2 security group for a general purpose server.
#
# This uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
#
# This uses environment variables:
#
#    * AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY
#    * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY
#
# The AWS EC2 security groups and settings for your account depend
# on how old your AWS account is, i.e. when you first created it.
# Older ones use "EC2 Classic" groups; newer ones use "VPC" groups.
#
# VPC means a virtual private cloud (VPC): a virtual network
# dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from
# other virtual networks in the AWS cloud. You can launch your AWS
# resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. You can
# configure your VPC; you can select its IP address range, create
# subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and
# security settings.
#
# To see if your account has VPC available, start here:
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home
#
#   * Look for the section called "Account Attributes".
#   * Look for "Supported Platforms", then "EC2" and/or "VPC".
#
# To see your VPC security groups:
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/
#
# Your VPC includes a default security group named "default".
#
# The group's initial rules are:
#
#   * deny all inbound traffic
#   * allow all outbound traffic
#   * allow all traffic between instances in the group
#
# You can't delete the default group.
# You can change the group's rules.
#
# Note that you can't use the security groups that you've created for
# use with EC2-Classic with instances in your VPC. You must create
# security groups specifically for use with instances in your VPC. The
# rules you create for use with a security group for a VPC can't
# reference a security group for EC2-Classic, and vice versa.
